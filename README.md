# Identification of DNA-Binding Proteins
This project focuses on the binary classification of DNA-binding proteins using machine learning techniques. The models implemented include a Deep Neural Network (DNN), specifically a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The goal is to accurately classify proteins as DNA-binding or non-DNA-binding.

Features
DNN/MLP Implementation: A deep neural network architecture using an MLP for classification.
SVM Implementation: Support Vector Machines for robust classification.
Feature Engineering: Techniques applied to prepare protein sequence data for input into the models.
Performance Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
